To install Grunt, you must first download and install node.js (which includes npm). npm stands for node packaged modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.
Then, from the command line: 1.Install grunt-cli globally with npm install -g grunt-cli.<br />
2.Navigate to the root /bootstrap/ directory, then run npm install. npm will look at the package.json file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.<br />

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.
